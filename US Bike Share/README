## US bike-share EDA project 

#####In this Project which is a Project from the Udacity Data Analysis Nano Degree, I used Python to Explore US bike-share dataset from 3 Cities and used Statistics to Answer the Following Questions:
*	The most frequent time of travel per Month, Day, and Hour of using bikes.
*	The most common start and end Stations.
*	The most frequent combination of start station and end station trip.
*	Total and mean Duration of trips.
*	How many females Vs. Male users.
*	What is the age of the youngest user, oldest user, and the average age of the whole user?
#####Despite being a console application but it is nicely interactive and clear about what I prompt the user to type and do.
